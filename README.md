# WIFI-PASSWORD-CRACKING-WITH-AIRCRACK-NG
Wireless security assessment of Wi-Fi password strength and resilience using authorized, lab-based testing with Aircrack-ng; focuses on findings and defensive recommendations.
As wireless connectivity becomes central to the functionality of modern IoT systems,
safeguarding Wi-Fi infrastructure is a top priority. Many IoT devices communicate over WPA2-
secured networks, which, while secure in theory, can be compromised in practice through
poorly implemented configurations and weak passphrases. This project simulates a real-world
penetration test on a WPA2-PSK network labeled “Zigman” using the Aircrack-ng suite. The
testing followed a red-team methodology, covering network scanning, handshake capturing,
and password cracking attempts via dictionary attacks. Aside the password being cracked, the
project demonstrates the feasibility of intercepting handshake packets and underscores the
need for robust wireless security practices. Recommendations include adopting WPA3,
enforcing strong password policies, and segmenting IoT networks.
